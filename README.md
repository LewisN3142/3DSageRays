# 3DSage-RayCaster

This project features a raycaster built by following 3DSage's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA) on Youtube and was developed using C++ and OpenGL (in particular, the now long-outdated GLUT package). 
I completed this project in July of 2022, as I wanted a short term goal to work on while completing the pre-reading for my Ph.D. I had some experience of scripting languages at the time, having used MATLAB, Python, and a little JavaScript while at university and was familiar with object oriented programming as a concept from secondary school, however I wanted to learn how to programme in C++ and develop working applications. 
With hindsight now, I see there are a multitude of improvements one could make to the code for this project &ndash; most prominently, it could be coded in several separate C++ files and use the aforementioned concept of object oriented programming to be more efficient and easier to read. 
I abandoned the project when the workload for my studies picked up and 3DSage shifted focus to a GBA themed game engine, but remained interested in the concept of raycasting and binary space partitioning (having been heavily inspired by early 90s games and John Carmack's work on Doom).

Should you wish to look over the project and compile it yourself, you may need to set up GLUT on your PC. 3DSage has also kindly provided a [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTk6W67dyR4) for doing so. Alternatively, if you simply wish to explore the raycaster as it is, you may download and run the [executable](https://github.com/LewisN3142/3DSageRays/tree/main/Debug) found in this repository. 
I may return to this project in the future and convert it into a full game, however I currently do not have plans to do so, in favour of creating a sector based game engine.
